# Letters Against Loneliness

This is the source code for the game [Letters Against Loneliness](https://pandaqi.com/letters-against-loneliness).

The game was made in Corona Engine, now Solar2D. The code is the final published version, without edits or changes.

You'll need to insert your own AdMob IDs ( + keystore) to build a mobile version, and perhaps upgrade / change a few parts to match the latest Solar2D version.
 
It contains two parts: the actual game (written in Lua) and a simulation that generates random puzzle levels (written in Java). This was basically my first experiment with both of these, so don't expect amazing code or architecture.
