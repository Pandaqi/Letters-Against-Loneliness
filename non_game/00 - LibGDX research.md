**LibGDX Research**

This document contains my research into *what LibGDX is* and *how best to learn/use it*.

**Why would I want to use LibGDX?**

-   I have ideas for games that need (convolutional) neural networks. There are standard libraries for Java that are fast enough.

-   It is apparently very good and active.

-   I want to try out many game engines and I already know Java, so hey.

**What is it?** LibGDX is a free and open source game engine.

-   It uses **Java**.

-   It can export to all platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS).

-   It supports both 2D and 3D.

-   It's more of a low-level support framework, than an actual engine. (It has no interface, misses a lot of quick access to functionality).

**Downloading:** LibGDX uses a small setup program. All necessary dependencies are downloaded via Gradle.

-   The setup program can be used to create a project with some basic template.

-   Use another IDE (such as Netbeans or IntelliJ) for actual Java coding.

**Setup:** For every platform, LibGDX needs a separate main class/starter file and a separate folder.

However, you can just create all of them and keep them bundled together.

-   Use only one ("android/assets" by default) for all art assets

-   Use "core" for all code and functionality present on all platforms.

**More setup:** from now on, it's just following tutorials and stuff.

-   The GitHub page has a Wiki => that seems to be the actual documentation, not the website itself
