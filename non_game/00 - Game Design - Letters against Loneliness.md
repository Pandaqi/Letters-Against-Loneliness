**Letters against Loneliness**

This is a (much better) remake of my original game "Nexus": <https://www.kongregate.com/games/Dalionzo/nexus>

The original mechanic of that game is solid. The music is also solid. The rest is garbage.

**Core Mechanic**

This is a **turn-based puzzle game**.

You can only do one thing: **place a post office**.

When you do, all previously placed post offices *that are on the same line*, send a letter towards the new post office.

When such a letter crosses a person, they become your friend.

Connect with all friends to pass each level :)

**Campaign Screen**

The campaign screen is simply one *huge* map of the whole world.

-   This map is simply created with the level editor => it thus has a circular/hexagony shape

-   It's divided into many different islands.

-   At game start, almost the whole map is "blacked out" / "inside fog" (so you can't see exactly where everything is)

Each level is represented by a FLAG (+city/town around it) with a clear indication of the level NUMBER and if you've already passed it.

This is how you use it:

-   When you start the game, you simply start at level 0, somewhere near the edge of the map.

-   When you complete a level, and return to the campaign screen, a *letter* will shoot from your current location to the new level. (Keeping with the theme!) Once it has reached the destination, it's revealed, and you can click/tap it to start the level.

**Monetization**

And this is where the **monetization** comes in:

-   Whenever you jump to a new island, you must **"unlock" the bridge**/gate towards it. To do so, you need to watch a rewarded video.

-   If you're stuck in a level, you can request **help/advice**. The level restarts, but half of the moves have already been completed for you => AUTO_SOLUTION = true until limit. (Because players might take a different route, I can't just determine the next move.) To use this, you need to watch a rewarded video.

(The desktop version does NOT have these gates or any advertisements. Within the mobile app, keep reminding players that there's a paid desktop version without ads/restrictions and with bonus content.)

Optional: extra tiles/characters/puzzles if you watch an ad OR random interstitials between levels.

**Action Calls**

When you transition to a level that does *not* have some tutorial/explanation, there's an X% chance you get an **action call**.

This is a popup/message that simply asks you to do something or check something:

-   Write a letter to someone who deserves it.

-   Ask yourself: when was the last time you talked face-to-face with your family/best friends?

-   Ask yourself: do you share more of yourself/secrets online than offline? Or the other way around?

-   Ask yourself: how many hours per day are you behind a screen?

-   Ask yourself: if internet disappeared tomorrow ... what would you do? What would you feel?

**Story**

**[Chapter 1 - Introduction]{.underline}**

One day Leyla woke up, but ... she didn't know why.

Her alarm hadn't gone off.

Not a single light was turned on.

Nobody was calling her or leaving messages on her phone.

In fact, her phone didn't work at all.

She got out of bed and looked outside. Empty. Silent.

Then she saw it: a huge black cloud hanging in the sky. Everywhere the cloud went, electric devices stopped working. No internet, no smartphone, nothing worked anymore.

What had happened? What had caused this disaster? Leyla immediately grabbed a piece of paper and wrote a letter to her friend Mark. Maybe he knew the answer ...

**\<\< HERE THE FIRST FEW LEVELS START (you only learn the basic mechanic) \>\>**

**[Chapter 2 -- The Prophecy]{.underline}**

Lala

Main idea: nobody here knows what happened. But they say a wise man lives in the mountains. And he is the one who spoke of a prophecy that said "one day, when the world depends on it the most, our technology will fail".

So, let's go looking for that man and hear what he has to say!

**\<\< New Mechanics: Terrain-types; forest + mountain \>\>**

**[Chapter 3 -- The Wise Man]{.underline}**

Main idea: the wise man tells them a few bits of new information/interesting things.

But, he says, the real secrets are hidden near the world's capital. Heavily guarded at all times. If you want to know more, if you want to stop this, you'll need to get past them. Perhaps ... you could send them a kind letter for distraction?

**IDEA:** At the end, the "bad guy" is like "Oh, huh, guess I also saved the climate. Nice." (Because electricity usage was brought down immensely.)

**IDEA:** The wise man randomly says something like "Only fools rush in" "What?" "Oh, just feels like something wise men would say." (it's from that Presley song)

**\<\< New Mechanics: Guards + Gates \>\>**

**[Chapter 4 -- The City of Alapom]{.underline}**

Lala

Main Idea: You've been able to breach the first layer of defense and find yourself in a new city. But, what's this? There's nobody on the street, except for a few builders.

When asked, they say "In search of Wi-Fi, people have been coming to our city in droves! We've been commanded to build many more houses ... but we don't have the blueprints. Could you help?"

**\<\< New Mechanics: Buildings (obstacle) + Builders (people) \>\>**

**\<\< Campaign screen: make this actually look like a city, with different building types \>\>**

**[Chapter 5 -- The Silence]{.underline}**

Lala

Main Idea: even in such a large city, you feel lonely. How must these people feel? Stuck in their houses, afraid to go outside? Maybe they just don't even know what to do anymore?

You decide to send some letters to help them.

**\<\< New Mechanics:** **Stubborn People (people) + Rotated Mirror Building (building) \>\>**

(The rotated mirror building is mainly for variety, and to keep to the theme of buildings in the city.)

**[Chapter 6 -- The Movement]{.underline}**

Lala

Main Idea: you've reached the end of town, ready to leave. But ... what's this? Nobody is allowed to leave.

A man walks up to you: "I haven't spoken with my daughter in years. Since she became an adult, she didn't want to go outside anymore or play games with me. She insists that chatting online is more than enough. And now, with the internet gone ... how could I reach her? Know she's safe?"

So you decide to send people tickets with which they can leave. (Or you contact whoever they are trying to contact, for them?)

AND you decide to distract the guards of this city?

**\<\< New Mechanics: Mover (people) + Building Switch (obstacle) \>\>**

**[Chapter 7 -- An Unexpected Group]{.underline}**

Lala

Main Idea: after some tricksy tricks with mirrors, you manage to escape town. What is it that they don't want you to see?

You've prepared yourself for anything: an enemy, a scary wilderness, a darkness.

Instead, you meet a group of people, smiling and playing games. They invite you for dinner and you ask: "what lies beyond? Do you know why the internet is gone?"

They say: "Internet? What is internet?"

Another voice pipes up: "Ah, I remember the internet. What a great time it was. Until ... those people decided to ruin it." A cold shiver made its way through the whole group. "We leave them alone, for we fear they cannot be helped. I have nothing more to tell you."

You say: "Oh. I'm sorry to bother you, I must go."

They say: "Well, if you really must go, we'll help you move a little quicker. And take great care of yourself, child, great dangers lie beyond ..."

**\<\< New Mechanics: Lovely People (people) + Zombies ( = enemy obstacle) \>\>**

(... is this too obvious? That I use zombies because people are addicted to phones and social media and such?)

**[Chapter 8 -- A Higher Call]{.underline}**

Lala

Main Idea: she gets into a more mountainous area and slows starts seeing more faces again. It's like the whole internet crisis going on out there hasn't even affected this part of the land. Why are they so different here?

Soon, people start recognizing you. "Hey, aren't you the one who asked Paul all these questions yesterday? You know what, I might have some information for you ..."

Somehow, word of mouth seems to travel quicker around here than even your letters could.

Finally, at the top of the mountain, you find someone with actual advice: "maybe, my dear, you should try a higher place. Sending letters from this mountain surely means they reach much further?"

**\<\< New Mechanics: Social People (people) + Heightened Tower (+plateau open spot)>\>**

**[Chapter 9 -- ??]{.underline}**

Lala

**TOWERS LEFT:** Endless Tower, 2 Frozen towers (is that the most interesting thing I can think of?), and of course the *Capitol*.

**OPEN SPOTS LEFT:** Duplicator/Endless, Frozen, Fertile spot. (... why did I reserve so much space for this?)

**OBSTACLES LEFT =>** I might want to give some slots from *open spots* to the *obstacles*, as I feel I need those more.

TO DO: A few more open spots + special towers

TO DO: A few more people (what are the most interesting ones that actually change something?)

TO DO: ... all modifier stuff, although that might be *so* different that it may not feel like the same game.

TO DO: Do more with the actual mystery: why has the internet disappeared? Slowly give bits of information, maybe something the "wise man" said is a recurring theme, etc.

> Maybe it's just the "wise man" who has destroyed all of it on purpose. He has been listening to people's stories for *years*, all of them complaining about the same thing, all of them wanting the same thing.
>
> Yet, they did not realize it was right in front of them.
>
> It took shutting down the internet to make them go outside, meet each other again, have real life contact. And now, they finally see.
>
> (Perhaps some of the people you meet were *also* the wise man, just in disguise?)

IDEAS LEFT:

-   She (Leyla) runs into an old friend she hasn't spoken to in *years*. It takes very long to recognize her, even though they used to be best friends.

-   Perhaps a pair of collectibles: one is "ice people", the other is "warm people".

    -   Ice people function as an obstacle and can't be reached.

    -   However, send a letter to a *warm* *person*, and every other person on the same line unfreezes and becomes collectible again!

    -   PROBLEM: This needs no tactic: warm people are already in the right place. Instead, maybe you need to start a fire? (How? Placing a tower on a special open spot?)

    -   OR: A warm person only activates other people in a single direction. By sending a letter to the warm person, they change their direction to wherever the letter came from.

-   Something about sending *love letters*

-   Something about founding new *towns/cities*

-   More things about *loneliness* and (subtly) talking about the importance of real life contact, and addiction to phones/internet.

**QUESTION:** Can I create moving people? Perhaps they *chase* you

> If that's not possible, can I at least add a mechanic that worsens every turn? For example, a single "bad" tile (lava, fire, whatever) at the start. Every turn, it sets all tiles around it on fire.
>
> To stop it, you need to send a letter to a specific person?
>
> (Of course, it must be impossible or unwise to send that letter too *soon*. There must be some advantages to *allowing* stuff to be on fire.)

(EVEN BETTER: "I've tried everything! Hack into their security systems, set off ... wait a minute ... how can they still have power while we don't? You MUST pass those guards and find out what's going on!)

(AND THEN, at the end of the story, it turns out that this "*wise man*" was the one who destroyed all electricity.)

(OR MAYBE it's a bit more silly yet realistic than that: he explains that he hasn't spoken with his daughter in years, hasn't been able to hug her or play those silly games they used to play. Was she gone? Was she too far away? No, she was simple addicted to her phone, didn't want to go outside/do stuff anymore, and now insists that she only needs to talk to her dad via Skype.)

> Maybe I can fill the world with these kinds of "stories" => my own frustrations with the world we live in, mostly.

-   People don't put in effort anymore.

-   People don't actually read/write anymore.

-   People don't have any attention (span) anymore.

-   People would rather be alone with their phone/tv shows, than be together and do something fun.

-   People are constantly stressed because of social media, because they always want to be reachable, etc.

-   People are somehow afraid of being near other people and even more afraid of having to spend time away from a screen.

ALTERNATIVELY: Every new chapter introduces a new type of *person*.

Every new chapter should introduce a new type of thing. (For example, chapter 4 is the first time that OPEN SPOTS are explained.)

Once introduced, more variations are introduced until the end of the game.

> Allow **story** to determine the mechanics. Also allow levels to be *really* spread thin -- I can regenerate them easily anyway.

To do in the remainder of the story:

-   Something about sending *love letters*

-   Something about founding new *towns/cities*

-   More things about *loneliness* and (subtly) talking about the importance of real life contact, and addiction to phones/internet.

-   Something about *cyberbullies* => maybe retheme the **enemy** mechanic to **cyberbully**.

**Theme (final)**

What if tomorrow ... internet would suddenly not exist anymore? (Something like that: should be a really strong hook/slogan => even though it feels like cheating)

The game takes place in a world where, due to some mysterious event, *internet* (or all computers?) has stopped working!

With internet and smartphones gone, nobody even talks to anyone anymore.

Leyla doesn't accept the loneliness and starts on a quest to discover the secret and restore the world.

(Of course, in the end, she turns internet back on but changes it so people can only use it like 1 hour every day :p)

**WHY IS THIS A GOOD IDEA?**

-   Strong hook/story

-   Can easily explain mechanics and why you're doing this.

-   Can actually create a (fantasy) world map, on which you can select levels!

**Alternative Mechanics**

**IDEA:** There are actually little cities on the map? Or houses? And then you can place postal offices in those cities to connect them and automatically reach everyone in between.

**ANOTHER IDEA:** You don't place towers, you move yourself. But every time you move, you leave behind something (a letter, a post office, whatever). And then, once you've moved, you shoot letters from yourself towards all the old locations.

**THE PROBLEM IS:** It feels counterintuitive. Why would you place post offices/move yourself, if you want to send letters?

Instead, isn't it much better if you send letters toward *people*. And anyone you reach, will also start sending letters from that turn onward?

**

**Object Types**

**Terrain**

**Water:** non-existent. Can't cross, can't place.

**Beach:** ??

**Grass:** default. Empty space, can do anything.

**Forest:** impassable by default. However, one letter is enough to break it (and become grass).

**Mountain:** impassable.

**Towers**

**Default:** just a tower

**Heightened Tower:** when a tower is placed on a *plateau* (type of open spot), it gains extra height. Any letter send *from* it, can go *over* forests and mountains.

**Duplicator:** when a tower is placed on a *duplicator* (type of open spot), it gains an extra power. Any letter send *from* it, will continue as long as possible, instead of stopping at first collectible. (Does it even go over water?)

**Capitol:** when a tower is placed on *fertile ground* (type of open spot), it becomes a town/city. Any letter send *to* it, will immediately go back one space, and transform into a building.

> If space unavailable, go around clockwise to find an available space. If nothing found, stop.

**FREE SPOT**

**FREE SPOT**

**Collectibles ("people")**

**Default:** If collected, they are happy and simply vanish from the field.

**Guard 1, Guard 2, Guard 3:** When collected, they open their corresponding gate(s).

**Builders:** If collected, they immediately build something on their spot (which functions as an obstacle)

**Stubborn:** The first letter that reaches it, brings the people out of the house (but you need to collect them once again).

**Movers:** If collected, they move away, leaving their spot a *gap* you can't cross. (Maybe they're in a boat or something.)

> ALTERNATIVE: When collected, they move one spot AWAY from the center. If they are out of bounds, or can't move (because of blocking mountain or something), they are collected finally.
>
> NAH, brings problems: no clear angles, takes too many letters to remove them.

**Social People:** If collected, they become a tower themselves (or start functioning like one).

**Lovely People:** If collected, they give you an extra move.

> Simulation/Game: count how many were used, subtract that from total move count

**Punctual People:** Can only be collected if the letter ends on the *exact same spot* as them.

**Lonely People:** Have actually built walls around themselves? And the only way to remove those, is by sending them a letter?

**Lovers / Family / Whatever:** You must collect them both with the same letter, otherwise it doesn't count.

Addition? In the simulation, just check if it should be included. If so, add the extra one to the list as well. (Maybe even allow more than two?)

> Implementation? When letter hits them, remove them, but remember it. If the letter reaches its end, but it hasn't hit more than one of this type, you immediately fail the level.

**Royal Letter (or just "important message"):** This person is expecting a very important letter. This letter is ALSO a unique tile somewhere on the field. You must first get the important letter, *then* deliver it to that person. (Otherwise, any letter reaching this person will just not be picked up.)

**Kind People:** When they receive a letter, they radiate a warmth around them. (So anyone in a circle around them also gets a letter? Or they melt any barriers around them?)

> Maybe that should be **Warm People**.
>
> Maybe I can have ice blocks/walls of ice. They work like mirrors by default, but you can remove them with the warm people.

**IDEA:** Some people are afraid/unaccustomed to people touching them or being near them. Although that saddens them -- they just want to talk to their friends and hug them! -- they understand and are looking for another way. So instead, they ask you (the player) to send letters for them.

**IDEA:** People who are "Great Writers" => Shakespeare, etc. They do something very special if you grab them. (Or you can just collect them in general, for funsies and bragging rights?)

**IDEA:** A person who, when they receive their letter, immediately creates a new town/city! So their cell becomes filled, but also all the cells around it.

> Should help fill up the game board. Also adds strategical options: you don't want to block things too soon.

**IDEA:** There are multiple "factions" or "social groups". They hate each other. By sending a letter to one of them, the others turn into stone/obstacle/disappear/temporarily don't receive any letters.

> How to bypass? **THAT'S THE QUESTION**

**(IDEA**: People that are somehow connected. You must send them the same letter => reach them in the same turn.)

**IDEA:** People that walk around on their own. (Might be very hard to simulate without being too expensive.)

**IDEA:** Actually change/assemble the *content* of the message. (For example, one person only accepts letters about LOVE. To create such a letter, you must first fetch a heart symbol somewhere else.)

> **YES THIS COULD WORK:** There are actual *letters* all over the map. When you cross these, you collect them. When they spell out a certain word, all your next letters will have this word in it.
>
> Above the people's heads is a **hint** about what they want to receive. (LOVE? KISS? HEAT? HUG? FRIEND?)

**IDEA:** More modes of "transportation" for letters; make it feel more like a living world.

**Obstacles**

Obstacles are almost always some type of *buildings*. (Terrain can also function as obstacle, but I classify that differently.)

Some buildings start on the map from the beginning. Others come into existence because you started a city somewhere.

> **IDEA/QUESTION:** The type of building that appears (when growing a city organically), can be changed if it happens to be placed on a special (open) spot??

**Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3:** Can be opened by collecting their corresponding guard.

**Enemy (better name?? Cyberbully?):** If you hit it, you instantly lose.

**Default building:** reflects letters.

**Rotated building:** default building, but letters are reflected into the next direction *clockwise*.

**Switcher:** hit it with a letter, and all letters go the other way around. (Hit it again, it goes back to normal.)

**Teleporter:** letters that go in, come out at another building.

> (HOW? WHAT DETERMINES THE LINK? I think this might not be feasible ...)

**Open Spots**

Open spots are "special", so there is no default. (You could say "grass" is the default.)

**Mountain Plateau:** If tower placed here, it becomes a heightened tower.

**Duplicator:** If tower placed here, it becomes a duplicator.

**Fertile Ground:** If tower placed here, it becomes a capitol.

**Time Machine:** Place a tower here; it takes a few turns before it is activated!

> For simulation purposes: just change tower type? (Decrement until it's a default tower.)

**One-Chance:** Place a tower here, or shoot something over it, and it immediately turns into an obstacle (/destroys itself)

**WHAT I WANT:** Something that has advantages when you place a tower on it, but also disadvantages. Something like:

"Laboratory"

-   If you place a tower here, you get an extra letter to send each turn.

-   However, this tower itself cannot send/receive any letters.

**IDEA:** A pre-written letter. (Love letter, or something?) You must collect this letter first, before you can send it to a "Lover Person". (Any other letters are not accepted!)

> Maybe this can become an *open spot*: so you have to, at some point, place a tower right there.

**Modifiers**

By default, at the start of the game, there are no modifiers. You can only place towers and follow the basic rules. Letters are sent when needed, no limits.

**Pen/Paper:** In some levels, you start with too few letters. Only by grabbing pen and paper do you get extra letters. (If you have no letters at any point, it's an instant fail.)

> Again, backwards implementation: just create a simulation in which grabbing pen/paper is part of the solution. Now reduce the letter count so that you *need* to grab it.
>
> One problem: you might run out of letters before you're able to grab the extra ones.
>
> How to fix? Keep track of the *interval* between grabbing new letters, and check if letters has run out by then. If so, discard the level anyway.

**Carrier Pigeon** ("postduif"): When you grab these, all letters next turn will be sent by pigeon. A pigeon can go over obstacles (including water).

**Bottle:** If you grab a bottle, you can send messages through water.

**Bus:** If you grab this, your letters can go through forests/cities.

**Lighthouse:** If you grab this, your next tower can be placed in the water.

**\
**

**Advanced Idea**

A game about loneliness: at the start, you are alone

Other people, however, are also alone.

You can send a letter to them by "shooting" it towards them (by placing a post office behind them??)

> You are only "connected" or "closer" to people who are on the same line as you. So, whenever you place something new, it only shoots lines from whatever is on the same line.

Anybody who receives a letter, will automatically send a letter back the next turn => letters go back-and-forth in this way.

During the game, you basically grow your social network => people you write, also start to write your new friends.

**EXTRA IDEA:** You get one free letter at the start. If you want/need to send more letters, you need to somehow gather the right resources (during the level):

-   Something to write on

-   Something to write with

-   Something to *transport* the letter

-   Some*one* to send it to

**EXTRA IDEA**: Message in a bottle. You are alone on an island, trying to communicate with the outside world. All you can do is throw a message in a bottle.

Water currents will move the message. Certain people will pick up the message and *put it through*. Others would destroy the message, or miss it, or ignore it. Others will change mode of transportation, or multiply the message.

In the end, you need to reach a specific special person. (Or, you need to reach all people within the level.)

**EXTRA EXTRA IDEA:** I feel like you could turn this into multiplayer or realtime, with the idea of "sending messages across the screen".

**YES THAT WAS THE IDEA I HAD:** Somehow, a game about "sending secret messages to the other player". At the start, both players write a code in secret. (Maybe they are allowed a 5 letter word, and each letter is then sent separately into the system.)

Then they need to send it to the other player, but the game throws all sorts of things in the way (path of the message is changed, enemies, wrong/deceiving signals, etc.)

**\
**

**Alternative Versions**

**IDEA:** Hexagonal grid! Allows more stuff to be on the same line!

**ANOTHER IDEA:** You are only "connected" or "closer" to people who are on the same line as you. So, whenever you place something new, it only shoots lines from whatever is on the same line.

-   A game about loneliness: at the start, you are alone

-   Other people, however, are also alone.

-   You can send a letter to them by "shooting" it towards them (by placing a post office behind them??)

-   Anybody who receives a letter, will automatically send a letter back the next turn => letters go back-and-forth in this way.

-   During the game, you basically grow your social network => people you write, also start to write your new friends.

In the end, you need to reach a specific special person. (Or, you need to reach all people within the level.)

**EXTRA EXTRA IDEA:** I feel like you could turn this into multiplayer or realtime, with the idea of "sending messages across the screen".

**OLD IDEA:**

Nexus

-   Playing field is a standard rectangular grid

-   All you can do is place "towers"

-   Every time you place a new tower, all old towers shoot a line towards it.

-   If such a line crosses a coin/powerup/whatever, you collect it.

-   The more you collect, or the fewer moves you need, the better your score!

-   Things like obstacles, mirrors, etc. change the things
